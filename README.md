### What is an API?
#
<code> An API, or application programming interface, is a set of defined rules that enable different applications to communicate with each other. It acts as an intermediary layer that processes data transfers between systems, letting companies open their application data and functionality to external third-party developers, business partners, and internal departments within their companies.

The OpenAI API can be applied to virtually any task that involves understanding or generating natural language or code. 
These models can be used for everything from content generation to semantic search and classification.
